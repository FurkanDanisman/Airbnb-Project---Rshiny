## Introduction of the Website

This website is a tool that can be used by Airbnb guests and hosts. We hope to provide a data-driven way for guests and hosts to analyze and understand the landscape of short-term accommodations in Amsterdam. Hosts can also benefit from this website by looking at different cleaning fees, reviews, rating scores, and prices. They can use the tools and visualization on this web app to get a sense of how prices are set on Airbnb and get a pulse-check for how they are positioned to competitors. For anyone wishing to become a host and list their property for the first time, this tool would be very useful for gathering information on how they should price their listing. New Airbnb hosts can use the website to gain a first-hand understanding of the competitive landscape for market entry and pricing strategy.


## Data Description

The data from this web app was retrieved from  [Airbnb data](https://data.world/aewart/airbnb-raw-data/workspace/file?filename=Unit_1_Project_Dataset+%281%29.csv.)

## Code

The website is created through R-shiny with the help of libraries such as **leaflet**, **worldcloud**, and **showtext** to create a world map design and make an analysis based on the results. During the coding process, many of the other libraries are used as well which can be found [here](https://github.com/FurkanDanisman/Airbnb-Project---Rshiny/blob/main/Code/Libraries%20and%20Packages). In the code there are 4 parts, as follows:

- Unpacking libraries 
- Defining the ui
- Defining the server
- Using Rshiny function to start the website

All of the parts are explained explicitly through the code to understand the process more clearly. The code of this project can be found by clicking [Airbnb-R-code](https://github.com/FurkanDanisman/Airbnb-Project---Rshiny/blob/main/Code/Airbnb-Project-Rshiny-code.R).
